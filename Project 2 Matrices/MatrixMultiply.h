/* typedef can be used to create a type alias. The statement:
 *		typedef oldType newType;
 * makes newType into an alias of oldType. oldType must actually be a type (e.g., int, double, double*)
 * and newType must be a name (e.g., int32_t, IEEEFloat, PtrDouble)
 * 
 * I'm creating an alias for double* 
 * I'm naming that alias PtrDouble
 * in that way, I can use the name PtrDouble whenever I need a pointer to a double
 * That makes it much easier for me to declare and work with arrays of pointers to doubles
 * i.e., the matrix list is an array
 * each element in the array is a pointer
 * and each pointer points to the first element (a double) in a matrix
 * so the matrix list is an array of PtrDouble elements, 
 * hence PtrDouble matrix_list[]
